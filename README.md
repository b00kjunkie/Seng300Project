# SENG300Project

Group project for SENG 300, Winter 2020 (Group 42). The program implements an appointment scheduling system that is to 
be used by Alberta hosptials. The program allows doctors, nurses, and patients to access the system. Doctors and 
patients can request appointments, based on the availability specified by doctors. Nurses confirm appointments, which 
then appear in the calendar schedule of the doctor and the patient.

Iteration 3:

The functionalities for all user stories in the product backlog have been completed. Code is fully commented with
all the required Javadoc.

You are welcome to access the system as a patient by registering a new patient account. Doctors and nurses cannot 
register their own accounts, and must be added to the system by the system administrator. There are several doctor,
nurse, and patient accounts already in the system. We list them below, and you are welcome to login to the system 
using any of these accounts.
